fle_get_block - another lab 5 function

dir_lookup(File *dir, char *name, File **file) - try to find a file named "name" in dir.

dir_alloc_file(struct File *dir, struct File **file) - set *file to point at a free File structure in dir. The caller is responsible for filling in the File fields.

walk_path(char *path, File **pdir, File **pf, char *lastelem) - evaluate a path name, startng at the root. On success, set *pf to the file we found and set *pdir to the directory the file is in. If we cannot find the fle but find the directory it should be in, set *pdir and copy the fnal path element nto lastelem.
